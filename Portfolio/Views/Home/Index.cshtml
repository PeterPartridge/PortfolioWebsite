            <div>
                <p>
                    I have always enjoyed building pcs and solving computer problems from a young age, so I have always had a great love for technology.
                    I started playing with computer game building programmes and found great excitment from just moving a single block on a screen.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Soon a freind hearing me telling the story of a moving block and how amasing it was to me, she sent me a book on C#, and this sparked my love for devlopment.
                    I first started courses on pluralsite for offline MVVM applications on .net, but this soon evlolved to a love and fasination of building an online application.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I have been training over the past year in both front and back end sides of .net devlopment and after alot of cheering ups and solving a problem,
                    to wall banging lows I found I enjoyed every minute, and the problems web devlopers are faced with on a daily basis makes me even more excited.
